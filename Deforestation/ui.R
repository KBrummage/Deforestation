This is saying that, generally, as a country has higher amounts of CO2 emissions, they are losing less forest area each year. This, intuitively, doesnâ€™t make sense as we would expect countries with high C02 emissions to lose the most forest each year. Further research led us to find that CO2 emissions from deforestation account for roughly 20% of global CO2 emissions, pointing towards the negative trend we did not find.")
